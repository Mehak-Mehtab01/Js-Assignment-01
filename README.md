JavaScript Alert Box and Script Placement Demonstration
Overview
This project focuses on using JavaScript alert boxes to interact with users, along with an illustration of the correct and incorrect placement of the <script> tag in an HTML document. It is designed as part of a JavaScript assignment to demonstrate basic alert functions and script placement.

Project Details
The HTML file contains multiple comments showcasing incorrect placements of the <script> tag, which demonstrates potential mistakes in HTML structuring. The JavaScript section features different alert box examples that you can run to test user interaction.

JavaScript Tasks Included:
Task 1: Display a greeting alert to the website visitor.
alert("Welcome to our website! We're glad to have you here.");

Task 2: Show an error alert for invalid password input.
alert("Error! Please enter a valid password");

Task 3: Show a message alert with a line break.
alert("Welcome to JS Land... \n Happy Coding!");

Task 4: Display sequential alerts.
alert("Welcome to JS Land...");
alert("Happy Coding! \n ⬛ Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs");

Task 5: Show an alert through the browser's console.
console.log(alert("Hello... I can run JS through my web browser's console"));

Script Placement Errors in HTML:
The HTML file contains comments indicating incorrect <script> tag placements, which can cause issues during execution. Proper placement of the <script> tag is important for efficient page loading and functionality. These placements include:

Part A: A comment shows where the <script> should be placed in the <head>, but it’s commented out incorrectly.
Part B, C, D: Other incorrect placements of the <script> tag are shown in comments, outside of where they should be.
How to Run
Uncomment the JavaScript alert boxes in the code to activate them.
Open the HTML file in a browser.
Use the browser's console to observe any logged alerts (Task 5).
Learnings
This project demonstrates:

The proper way to use JavaScript alert boxes.
How incorrect placement of the <script> tag can affect a webpage's behavior.
Console-based JavaScript execution through console.log.
